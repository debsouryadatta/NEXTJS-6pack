// * #1 Introduction to Next Js, Understanding the Features and Benefits | Mastering Next Js
// * 1.NextJS does not require to install various libraries which was needed for react, it already has those libraries installed. Its now a full stack.

// * 2. In summary, server-side rendering is better for applications that require high performance, search engine optimization, and scalability. On the other hand, client-side rendering is better for applications that require a lot of interactivity and faster development time.

// * 3. NextJS features - Server side rendering, Simple routing, Static site generation(Through CDN), Optimised performance(sent required code in small chunks), hot code reloading(time required for starting the server during development >>> faster), Api routes.

// * 4. Advantages Over React.Js - 
// • Search Engine Optimization
// • Production Ready
// • Image Optimization
// • Data Fetching Methods
// • 700x faster
// • API routes
// • Typescript Support

// * 5. Next.Js 13 Features - 
// • App Directory
// • Layouts
// • Server Component
// • Fetch API Extended
// • Turbo Pack






// * #2 Next.js Setup: Installation and Folder Structure Demystified | Mastering Next Js
// * 1. First of all we installed the next app without ts, tailwind, app directory, src directory.
// * 2. Then we converted the whole application to app directory by altering the next.config.js file and making an app directory which consists of page.jsx
// * 3. Since we are using app directory, we have to delete the main files i.e. _app.js,index.js and make the page.jsx as the main file of the application
// * 4. Since page.jsx is a server component so we can't use react hooks there.
